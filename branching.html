        <p>

            Branching helps minimise conflicts and isolate work from the main
            codebase. It also “quarantines” unreviewed code or potential bugs so
            they don’t affect the main branch.

            Every Git project starts with a single branch — usually called main (or
            master in older repositories).

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Devs don’t work directly on main
            With multiple developers contributing simultaneously, the main branch
            can quickly become messy with conflicts.

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
           Best practice 
           <ul >
            <li>Each developer creates a separate branch for their work</li>
            <li>They make commits and test their code inside that branch.</li>
            <li>Once the work is complete and reviewed, the branch is merged back
                into main.</li>          
           </ul>
        </p>
        <br>

            Benefits
            Best practice 
           <ul >
            <li>Reduces conflicts on main.</li>
            <li>Keeps untested or experimental code separate.</li>
            <li>Makes collaboration cleaner and easier to manage.</li>          
           </ul>
       </p>

        <p>
            Create branches.
            To create a branch, use the checkout command. The new branch will be an exact copy of the branch you
            were on when you ran the command. Typically, new branches are always created from the main branch
             <p><code>git  git checkout -b branch-name</code> - pull specific branch</p>
             <p><code> git checkout branch-name</code> // If you want to switch to an existing branch, omit -b</p>
             Once inside the new branch, you can add, commit, and push changes as usual. These changes will not affect other branches.            
            <p><code> git checkout .</code> // discards all un-staged changes in the current branch but keeps you on the same branch.</p>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Merge main into your branch.
            <p>When you’ve finished working in your branch, before opening the PR, it’s good to update your branch and resolve
               conflicts. Since your branch was created from an earlier version of main, conflicts are possible. 
                Using branches allows you to isolate these conflicts without affecting other branches.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Switch to the main branch and update it. This ensures your local main branch is up-to-date.
                    <code>git checkout main</code>
                    <code>git pull</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    witch back to your feature branch and merge the latest main into it:
                    <code> git checkout your-branch   </code>
                    <code> git merge main </code>
                </li>
            </ul>
            Any conflicts will appear in your branch, not in main. 
            <span>*** Remember: you merge other branches into your current branch, not the other way around.***</span>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Resolve conflicts
            <p>If you encounter a conflict, the only way to resolve it is to manually decide which code to keep. </p>
            <p>Often, you’ll want to keep all the code, the conflict usually happens because two sets of changes were made on the
                same lines.</p>
            <p>VS Code provides tools to help with this, but when you’re learning version control, it’s a good idea to resolve
                conflicts manually. </p>
            <p>Conflicts are marked in the file with symbols like <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>>. 
               You will need to decide to keep the current change or accept the incoming change, or keep both to resolve the
               conflict.</p>
            <p>️Always check with your team members to ensure you don’t accidentally delete any important code</p>
