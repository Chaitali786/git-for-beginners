                <h1>Git Branching</h1>
                <p>
                    Branching helps minimize conflicts and isolate work from the main
                    codebase. It also “quarantines” unreviewed code or potential bugs so
                    they don’t affect the main branch.
                    Every Git project starts with a single branch — usually called main (or
                    master in older repositories).
                    Devs don’t work directly on main
                    With multiple developers contributing simultaneously, the main branch
                    can quickly become messy with conflicts.

                <h2>Create Branches</h2>
                <p>
                    To create a branch, use the <code>checkout</code> command. The new branch will be an exact copy of
                    the branch you
                    were on when you ran the command. Typically, new branches are created from the <strong>main</strong>
                    branch.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Create and switch to a new branch:</strong>
                        <pre><code>git checkout -b branch-name</code></pre>
                        <p>This creates and switches to a new branch called <code>branch-name</code>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Switch to an existing branch:</strong>
                        <pre><code>git checkout branch-name</code></pre>
                        <p>Use this if the branch already exists. Omit the <code>-b</code> flag.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Discard all un-staged changes:</strong>
                        <pre><code>git checkout .</code></pre>
                        <p>This reverts un-staged changes in your current working directory without switching branches.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Once you're inside the new branch, you can <code>add</code>, <code>commit</code>, and
                    <code>push</code> changes as usual.
                    These changes will not affect other branches unless you merge them later.

                <h2>Merge <code>"main"</code> into Your Branch</h2>
                <p>
                    When you’ve finished working in your feature branch, it’s a good idea to update it before opening a
                    pull request.
                    Since your branch was likely created from an earlier version of <code>main</code>, there could be
                    conflicts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using branches allows you to isolate these conflicts without affecting other developers or the main
                    codebase.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Switch to the main branch and update it:</strong>
                        <p>This ensures your local <code>main</code> branch is up to date with the latest changes.</p>
                        <pre><code>git checkout main </code></pre>
                        <pre><code>git pull</code> </pre>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Switch back to your feature branch and merge <code>main</code> into it:</strong>
                        <pre><code>git checkout your-branch</code></pre>
                        <pre><code>git merge main</code></pre>

                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Any merge conflicts will appear in your branch — not in <code>main</code>. You can safely resolve
                    them in isolation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong> Note:</strong> You always merge other branches <strong>into your current branch</strong>,
                    not the other way around.
                </p>

                <h2>Resolve Conflicts</h2>
                <p>
                    If you encounter a conflict during a merge, the only way to resolve it is to manually decide which
                    code to keep.
                    Conflicts typically occur when changes have been made to the same lines of code in both branches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Often, you may want to keep all the code — but you’ll need to make a conscious decision about which
                    version (or combination) to retain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    VS Code provides helpful tools to assist with conflict resolution, but when you’re learning version
                    control,
                    it’s recommended to practice resolving them manually to better understand how Git works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conflicts are clearly marked in your file like this:
               
                <code>
                    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD 
                    your changes
                    =======
                    incoming changes
                    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; branch-name
                    
                </code>
                 </p>



                <p>
                    You will need to choose between:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keeping the current change</li>
                    <li>Accepting the incoming change</li>
                    <li>Keeping both changes and editing the file accordingly</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    <strong>Always check with your team members</strong> before resolving and committing, to ensure you
                    don’t remove or overwrite important code by mistake.
