  <h1>Project Page - Git and GitHub for Beginners</h1>

  <h2>Why Remote Repositories Are Important</h2>
  <p> Remote repositories are necessary for collaboration, serving as a central hub for teams to share and synchronize code. They provide a critical backup of the project, protecting against local data loss and ensuring progress isn't tied to a single machine

</p>

  <h2>Steps to Create a Project on GitHub</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a>.</li>
    <li>Log in to your account or create a free one.</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>+</strong> button in the top right and choose <strong>New repository</strong>.</li>
    <li>Enter a <strong>Repository name</strong> (for example: <code>my-project</code>).</li>
    <li>Write a short description (optional).</li>
    <li>Choose if your repo will be <strong>Public</strong> (everyone can see it) or <strong>Private</strong> (only you can see it).</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Create repository</strong>.</li>
    <li>Copy the web address (URL) that looks like this: <code>https://github.com/yourusername/my-project.git</code>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Git Commands are need </h2>

  <h3>1. Create a Project in Computer</h3>
  <p>Use these commands in terminal or Git Bash:</p>
  <pre><code># Create a new folder for the project
mkdir my-project
cd my-project

# Start a new Git repository
git init

# Create a file called README.md
echo "# My Project" > README.md

# Save your changes
git add README.md
git commit -m "First commit"</code></pre>

  <h3>2. Link the Local Project to GitHub</h3>
  <pre><code># Connect the  local project to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-project.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Upload your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main</code></pre>

  <h2>How Other People Can Help with Your Project</h2>

  <h3>1. If You Add Them as a Collaborator</h3>
  <p>Collaborators can make changes directly to your GitHub project.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to your GitHub repo → <strong>Settings → Collaborators</strong>.</li>
    <li>Add your friend’s GitHub username or email.</li>
    <li>They can copy your project to their computer using:</li>
  </ol>
  <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-project.git</code></pre>
  <ol start="4">
    <li>They can make changes, save them, and send them back to GitHub with <code>git push</code>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>2. If Your Project Is Public (Open to Everyone)</h3>
<p>If your project is public, anyone can help you improve it. Here’s how it works in simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Someone clicks the <strong>Fork</strong> button on your GitHub page to make their own copy of your project.</li>
<li>They make changes or add new features in their copy.</li>
<li>When they finish, they click <strong>Pull Request</strong> to ask you to add their changes to your project.</li>
<li>You look at their changes and decide whether to accept them or not.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is how people work together on open-source projects on GitHub.</p>


<h2>Tip</h2>
<p>Always include a file called <code>README.md</code>. It explains what your project does and how others can use it.</p>
