## 🤝 Contributing

Since this is a group project, everyone contributed to different sections of the website and the repository.

Our workflow:

1. Each team member created their own **feature branch** for the section they worked on.
2. Each person **committed their changes** and **pushed** them to the remote repository.
3. We merged feature branches into the **`dev` branch** first.
4. While raising PRs, we added a team member as a **reviewer**.
5. After careful review and approval, changes were merged into **`dev`**.
6. We tested work on `dev`, and after that merged into the **`main` branch**.
7. Merge conflicts were resolved along the way to ensure smooth integration.
